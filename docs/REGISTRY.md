# Registry configuration

## General info
Makisu supports TLS and Basic Auth with Docker registry (Docker Hub, GCR, and private registries).
By default, TLS is enabled and makisu uses a list of common root CA certs to authenticate registry.
```go
// Config contains Docker registry client configuration.
type Config struct {
  Concurrency int           `yaml:"concurrency"`
  Timeout     time.Duration `yaml:"timeout"`
  Retries     int           `yaml:"retries"`
  PushRate    float64       `yaml:"push_rate"`
  // If not specify, a default chunk size will be used.
  // Set it to -1 to turn off chunk upload.
  // NOTE: gcr does not support chunked upload.
  PushChunk int64           `yaml:"push_chunk"`
  Security  security.Config{
    TLS       *httputil.TLSConfig `yaml:"tls"`
    BasicAuth *types.AuthConfig   `yaml:"basic"`
  }`yaml:"security"`
}
```

Configs can be passed in through the `--registry-config` flag, either as filepath, or as a raw json blob :
```
--registry-config='{"gcr.io": {"makisu-project/*": {"push_chunk": -1, "security": {"basic": {"username": "_json_key", "password": "<escaped key here>"}}}}}'
```
Consider using the great tool [yq](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq) to convert your yaml configuration into the blob that can be passed in.


## Examples
For the convenience to work with all public Docker Hub repositories including library/.*, a default config is provided:
```yaml
index.docker.io:
  .*:
    security:
      tls:
        client:
          disabled: false
      // Docker Hub requires basic auth with empty username and password for all public repositories.
      basic:
        username: ""
        password: ""
```

Example config for GCR:
```yaml
"gcr.io":
  "makisu-project/*":
    push_chunk: -1
    security:
      basic:
        username: _json_key
        password: |-
            {
                <json here>
            }
```

To configure your own registry endpoint, pass a custom configuration file to Makisu with `--registry-config=${PATH_TO_CONFIG}`.:
```yaml
[registry]:
  [repo]:
    security:
      tls:
        client:
          disabled: false
          cert:
            path: <path to cert>
          key:
            path: <path to key>
          passphrase
            path: <path to passphrase>
        ca:
          cert:
            path: <path to ca certs, appends to system certs. A list of common ca certs are used if empty>
      basic:
        username: <username>
        password: <password>
```

## Cred helper

Makisu images (>= 0.1.8) contains ECR and GCR cred helper binaries.
To use them, plese pass in the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with corresponding registry config.

Example AWS ECR config:
```yaml
"someawsregistry":
  "my-project/*":
    security:
      credsStore: ecr-login
```

Example GCR config:
```yaml
"gcr.io":
  "my-project/*":
    security:
      credsStore: gcr
```
